# Tests Tracking

## _Better than Spreadsheets_

## Description

This application was developed to solve a business issue I was facing while working for a company a while ago. We were using spreadsheets to store all test results and we had no way or any automation to search for previous test results or to know how we were doing as a team based on the results of the tests.

## Features
  - Individual page for each kind of hardware tested.
  - PIE Chart with total hardware tested.
  - BAR Chart with number of FAILURES and PASSES for each kind of hardware.
  - Search option by serial number.
  - Option to Export to Excel sheet.
  - Sorte data from a range of Date.

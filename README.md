### _Better than Spreadsheets_

## Description

This web application was created to address a critical business challenge I encountered during my previous employment. At the time, our team relied on spreadsheets to store and manage test results. This approach lacked automation and made it difficult to track our progress over time or retrieve specific test results. As a solution, I developed this application using modern web technologies to enable easy and automated storage, search, and retrieval of test results. With this tool, businesses can better manage their test results, evaluate their team's performance, and drive improvements across the board.

## Features
  - Individual page for each kind of hardware tested.
  - PIE Chart with total hardware tested.
  - BAR Chart with number of FAILURES and PASSES for each kind of hardware.
  - Search option by serial number.
  - Option to Export to Excel sheet.
  - Sorte data from a range of Date.
  
## Tech Stack
